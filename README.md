## Running the server

1) Open `app.js` and start the app by clicking on the "Run" button in the top menu.

2) Alternatively you can launch the app from the Terminal:

    $ node app.js

Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://omb-search-hiq-codetest-lsdata.c9users.io'.

Cheers :)
